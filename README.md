# Rock Paper Scissors Practice

This was a project to practice HTML/CSS/Javascript. I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) tutorial and then added some additional style on top. The tutorial teaches a perfect blend of each language which is exactly what I was looking for in this project.

If you're interested in checking out/playing around with the code you can either clone the repository or follow the tutorial linked above.
